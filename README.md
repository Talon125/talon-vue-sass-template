# Vue + Sass "Template"

> Work in progress!

This repository contains a Vue project showcasing Vue **components** I've made. 
This is meant to act like a **style framework**, almost. The components' design 
are insired by **skeuomorphism** and "Web 2.0 Gloss" or "Frutiger Aero". E.g. 
Aero, found in Windows Vista and 7. Mainly that era of design; between the late 
2000s and early 2010s.

This will ultimately be used **for my website**
([oktalon-szoradi.github.io](oktalon-szoradi.github.io)), as I'm planning to
switch to Vue and would like the styles to be made using Sass and linted with
Stylelint.

Make sure software rendering isn't activated by going to `about:config` and
setting `gfx.webrender.software` to `false`.
