# Vue + Sass "Template"

> [!WARNING]
> Development paused/stalled

This was originally gonna be just components that I can then use for my website.
But I then just decided to make a different branch `ark-ui` (and use Ark UI)
and just make only my site there instead of a general thingy. This branch is
still here and untouched, though. I might come back to it in the future, but as
of writing this (2025-07-08), I don't have any plans to.

My website's repo, by the way:

This repository contains a Vue project showcasing Vue **components** I've made.
This is meant to act like a **style framework**, almost. The components' design
are insired by **skeuomorphism** and "Web 2.0 Gloss" or "Frutiger Aero". E.g.
Aero, found in Windows Vista and 7. Mainly that era of design; between the late
2000s and early 2010s.

setting `gfx.webrender.software` to `false`.
