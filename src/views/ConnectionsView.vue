            I also have a Discord account dedicated for school. Well, it was.
            During the distance learning era, 1-2 teachers decided to use
            Discord instead of Google Meet, so, as I do, I decided to separate
            personal and school.
          </p>
          I don't use it anymore. It's more of just a "note-to-self" account
          now. I log into it rarely. So... not gonna share it here lol.

          Notris Foes is a revival of Tetris Friends. This game brings me
          nostalgia, as I played it quite a bit in my childhood. When I saw it
          was going to shut down at the end of May 2019, I started playing it
          much more and actually got into Tetris, i.e. learning T-Spins and all
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's still very much work-in-progress, however. So the link to my
          profile won't actually show you anything. But the ID is my account
          tho&emsp;:p
        </p>
        There's also a different thingy called Spirit Account, which aims to
        bring back those old Facebook Flash games, like Tetris Battle (which I
        didn't play much back then). Development here's a bit more active.

        I'm a RŌBLOX veteran&emsp;:p<br />
        I don't play it much anymore, though.
        <p>Alright. Why do I have 4 accounts?</p>
        <p>
          So, I joined RŌBLOX in late 2013 under the username <b>oktalon</b>,
          since my friend recommended it to me lol (so I kinda technically know
          this game since 2012, I think). The thing is, however, I signed up
          using my dad's Facebook account (yeah that used to be an option back
          then. As well as not needing an account at all). One day we were at
          Panera Bread, and my parents needed the laptop I played on, so I had
          to use our other one. I don't remember what I did, but a new account
          was made... (<b>Talonblue5</b>). So I somehow lost my old account. I
          wasn't happy and wrote in the About Me "THIS IS NOT ME" lol.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point I decided to make another account, <b>Taloncool5</b>,
          and actually played with this one for a while. But like what happened
          last time, at some point something happened because the Facebook login
          is <i>weird</i>, and I lost access to that one too. I then decide to
          make an actual account with a password and all that instead of just
          using my dad's Facebook. Probably because by now I had my own email
          address. I can't quite remember, but I think I accidentally made a few
          accounts and forgot the password. But I ended up on
          <b>XxAwesomeGamerDudexX</b>. Yeah... 9-year-old me thought that was a
          cool username. Since I saw other people also put Xs around their
          usernames.
        </p>
        <p>
          RŌBLOX, or maybe I should write ROBLOX instead, then goes on to
          change. A lot. In my opinion, it feels too corporate now. The website
          looks like some generic clothing store, and fun terms like "Builders
          Club" are now replaced with boring generic words like "Premium".
        </p>
        <b>Fun Fact:</b> The icon I'm using here is my SVG recreation of the old
        RŌBLOX icon! It's not perfect and kinda looks odd in some places if you
        really zoom in on some parts, but at a small-ish size like 128&times;128
        it's pretty close to the original!
