The purpose of this directory is to contain the file(s) for my logo and this
copyright notice file. I do not want others using my logo [without my
permission], so it is not under any license.

As of 2025-03-03, there is one file: `TalonLogo.png`. I've decided to use an
image sprite instead of 3 separate files. Learn more about image sprites here:
